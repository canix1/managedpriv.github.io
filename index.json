[{"categories":["Privilege Identity Management","Azure AD"],"contents":"In this article I will dig into the possible ways of adding memberships in roles and groups in Azure AD and Azure resources. I will especially focus on when you can use the just-in-time privilege access feature in Privilege Identity Management (PIM). With the preview function Privileged access groups there is more opportunities to make use of the awesome features of PIM. I will discuss a couple of scenarios where this might not be such a good idea.\nPrivilege access groups Privileged access groups is a cool feature that allows you to create new groups that are protected from normal group management i.e. only Global Administrator and Privileged Role Administrator can managed the members. You also get the same role settings like Azure AD roles have.\nBut there is a big difference! These groups have owners that can manage the group, but the owners do not have to be a member of any privileged group at all.\nThese Azure AD groups are either security groups or Microsoft 365 groups, that have been enabled for Azure AD roles can be assigned to the group. What happens is that the group get its property isAssignableToRole set to true. You can only enable this feature while creating the group.\nPowerShell example Creating a Microsoft 365 group that is assignable to roles.\nNew-AzureADMSGroup -DisplayName \u0026#34;AAD M365 Group /w AAD Role\u0026#34; -Description \u0026#34;This group is assigned to Helpdesk Administrator built-in role in Azure AD.\u0026#34; -MailEnabled $true -SecurityEnabled $true -MailNickName \u0026#34;AADM365Group/wAADRole\u0026#34; -IsAssignableToRole $true    Note: Your PIM instance must have been upgraded to support privileged access groups.    Small extract of properties of a group with isAssignableToRole: true\n{ \u0026quot;id\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;909fdafa-1b1f-4ce3-8258-fba999a24ff9\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;deletedDateTime\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;classification\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;createdDateTime\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;2020-10-27T12:16:02Z\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;creationOptions\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;description\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;displayName\u0026quot;: \u0026quot;AAD M365 Group /w AAD Role\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;expirationDateTime\u0026quot;: null, \u0026quot;groupTypes\u0026quot;: [], \u0026quot;isAssignableToRole\u0026quot;: true, } You cannot change this value after the group is created since its immutable. If you try to change this value for an existing group, you will get this error:\nValue for IsAssignableToRole cannot be updated for groups assignable to role. \nThere is a maximum number of 251 for role-assignable groups per Azure AD tenant.\nWhen an Azure AD group is enabled for privileged access management you can manage the members or the owners through PIM and select between active or eligible access.\nMember types There are three states in which an object can be member of a group in a scenario where PIM has been deployed. These are the three different states:\nEligible - The member has to take actions to activate the privilege access.\nActive - The member doesn’t need to perform any action to active the privilege access.\nDirect membership - This means that the member has been added to the group or role outside of PIM. PIM cannot manage the membership with just-in-time access. This type of membership is either Assigned or Dynamic.\nWhat different objects can have members in Azure you might ask?\nObjects that can have members:\n Azure AD Roles Azure AD Custom Roles Azure AD Security Group Azure AD Security Group Synced Azure AD Microsoft 365 Group Azure Roles Azure Custom Roles  Membership by object type Below is a matrix of the different memberships that can take place in Azure and through PIM. I have found that Azure AD Custom Roles and Azure Custom Roles behave the same as built in roles so custom roles do not have an own column.\nColumn headings represent the objects that can have members. Table rows contain the objects that are potential members.\n   Possible member AAD Role Az Role AAD Security Group *AAD Security Group /W AAD Roles AAD M365 Group *AAD M365 Group /W AAD Roles Synced Group     User P P D P P P -   Synced User P P D P P P D   AAD Role - - - - - - -   AZ Role - - - - - - -   ADD Security Group - P D P - P -   AAD Security Group /W AAD Roles P P D P - P -   AAD M365 Group - P D P - P -   AAD M365 Group /W AAD Roles P P D P - P -   Synced Group - P D P - P -     P = Active/eligible assignment possible with PIM D = Direct member only, PIM not supported - = Cannot be a member * = /W AAD Roles is the Azure AD roles can be assigned to the group setting that enables an Azure AD group for privilege access. This is a preview feature at the time of writing.  Nesting scenario Microsoft suggest some scenarios in the article Management capabilities for privileged access Azure AD groups (preview) about privileged access groups\n       Visibility Lost Even though this is a totally legitimate scenario it might not be the best option from a security perspective…\nWhy?\nAzure AD Privilege Identity Manager has lost visibility in who has role memberships.\nBellow you can see that PIM tells you that Global Administrator has 1 eligible and 1 active member.\n       This is not true!\nThere are in fact 4 Global Administrator\u0026lsquo;s.\n1 permanent account and 3 eligible accounts.\nLet us go through why.\nThe account myga is a permanent member of Global Administrator, which is visualized by PIM’s dashboard.\n       Global Administrator has also an “IsAssignableToRole”-enabled group called AAD Security Group /w AAD Role as eligible member, which is also visualized by PIM’s dashboard.\n       When we examine the members of AAD Security Group /w AAD Role we see that is has a standard security group as eligible member.\nThis is where PIM lost it.\nThe nesting is not calculated in the PIM dashboard.\n       And if we look at the group AAD Security Group we see it has three direct members. Also not calculated by the PIM dashboard.\n       Possible Attack Path When you create complex schemes for you privileged access you might lose insight and control on \u0026ldquo;who can do what\u0026rdquo;.\n       If Anna is made owner for AAD Security Group or if she would be Group Administrator, she could add members to AAD Security Group. Any Member of AAD Security Group can activate access to AAD Security Group /W AAD Role.\nLet say Anna put her own account in to this group in AAD Security Group and activate AAD Security Group /W AAD Role in PIM.\nNow she can activate the Global Administrator role since AAD Security Group /W AAD Role is eligible to it.\nPossible Attack Path - Example Needless to say, we expose the highly privileged roles managed by PIM in a new way when nesting with privileged access groups or standard groups for that matter too.\nExposure araises from the fact that:\n  - Owner of a privilged access group or standard group..\n - does not follow the role requirements or process in PIM - does not require any privilged group    - Nesting groups in roles moves the control to other admins outside of PIM\n  I draw a simple Bloodhound-like attack graph bellow go give you an example of control paths that exist. This picture is far from the full graph of possible attack paths.\n       Conclusion It is crucial that administrators understand all the ways to control objects and how the tools work. Because if they don\u0026rsquo;t , they might introduce new weaknesses in the design.\nHere are a few things to consider into your design:\n nesting groups in roles make PIM loose visibility nesting groups in roles moves the control to other admins outside of PIM privileged access groups can be nested privileged access groups have owners if synced groups are nested in to privileged access groups or Azure roles the control is moved to on-premise Active Directory  References Use cloud groups to manage role assignments in Azure Active Directory (preview)\nhttps://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/roles/groups-concept\nManagement capabilities for privileged access Azure AD groups (preview) https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/privileged-identity-management/groups-features\nBloodHound\nhttps://github.com/BloodHoundAD/BloodHound\n","permalink":"https://managedpriv.com/blog/azure-ad-group-nesting/","tags":["Azure AD","Privilege Access","PIM"],"title":"Exposing Azure AD Roles with privileged access groups"},{"categories":["ACL","GPO","AD ACL Scanner","Active Directory"],"contents":"In the previous post Part 1 I introduced a way to detect a malicious actor account in the access control list of the domain root. In this post I will show you how to identify persistence and privilege creep on a domain via Group Policy permissions.\nGroup Policies controls your environment and settings so any control over a GPO linked to a scope of management that covers any computer or user gives the attacker an extremely powerful tool and possibilities to pursue the objectives.\nThe most obvious locations where you should have monitoring turned on and absolute control of are:\n Domain root Domain Controllers organizational unit  Any accounts having control over group policies at these locations owns the domain! These accounts are Tier 0 accounts and should be treated as the same.\nIf you are not familiar with the Tier Model and Active Directory you must read up on it. For more information on the Tier Model see https://aka.ms/tiermodel\nObjectives   Detect defense evasion via Group Policy Modification (MITTRE ATT\u0026amp;CK T1484)\n  Identify gaps in the principle of least privilege NIST AC-6 (5)\n  GROUP POLICY OBJECTS Group Polices are objects in Active Directory and has access control list like all the objects in Active Directory.\nWhat are the default permissions of a GPO you might wonder? Here\u0026rsquo;s the default permissions the group policy gets at creation, this is the value of the DefaultSecurityDescriptor attribute in the Schema of Active Directory:\nDn: CN=Group-Policy-Container,CN=Schema,CN=Configuration,DC=contoso,DC=com defaultSecurityDescriptor: D:P(A;CI;RPWPCCDCLCLOLORCWOWDSDDTSW;;;DA)(A;CI;RPWPCCDCLCLOLORCWOWDSDDTSW;;;EA) (A;CI;RPWPCCDCLCLOLORCWOWDSDDTSW;;;CO)(A;CI;RPWPCCDCLCLORCWOWDSDDTSW;;;SY)(A;CI;RPLCLORC;;;AU)(OA;CI;CR;edacfd8f-ffb3-11d1-b41d-00a0c968f939;;AU)(A;CI;LCRPLORC;;;ED); \nOk, conclusions on this. The creator of the GPO will get full control and so does the Domain Admins, Enterprise Admins and System. Authenticated users can apply and read the GPO\u0026rsquo;s by default. The forests domain controllers are assured read access on new GPOs.\nADVANCED HUNTING Let\u0026rsquo;s hunt for misconfigurations on GPO\u0026rsquo;s linked to the Domain Controller OU.\nTo do that we add the parameter -GPO to ADACLScan.ps1\nWe want only to see critical permissions.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;OU=Domain Controllers,DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -GPO -Criticality Critical | ft \nThe result contains a lot of expected permissions but also missing out an important part of the security decscriptor… The Owner.\nTime to filter out expected permissions and include the owner\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;OU=Domain Controllers,DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -GPO -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn -Owner | ft \nWe just identified an attempted Defense Evasion (MITTRE ATT\u0026amp;CK ID:T1484).\nThe account CONTOSO\\APT29 can perform malicious GPO modifications like Scheduled Task, Disabling Security Tools, Remote File Copy, Create Account, Service Execution and more.\nRemediation action Replace the owner on WSUS Patch Schedule 1 with Domain Admins.\nLet us continue analyzing the ACL.\nWSUS Admins is a group and we need to know what accounts are members and the nested groups. Add -RecursiveFind to the command.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;OU=Domain Controllers,DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -GPO -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn -Owner -RecursiveFind | ft \nWe got two admins, Alice and Bob, but who is joe?\n\nIt is our disgruntled employee Joe! There is a risk that Joe might take retaliatory actions by disrupting the business or stealing information.\nJoe is a member of the SCCM Admins that are nested in to the WSUS Admins group. We do not consider the SCCM Admins as \u0026ldquo;Tier 0\u0026rdquo; admins and it should not have control over Domain Controllers.\nWhat we got here is an example of privilege creep. We are not enforcing the principle of least-privilege NIST AC-6 (5) and we should look into our access management process to identify the gap in the process that led to this problem.\nRemediation action  Remove SCCM Admins from WSUS Admins. Monitor for security group managent events in the security log on the domain controllers.  DETECTION Besides assessing your GPO\u0026rsquo;s ACL, you should monitor for changes to group policy objects and privileged groups.

I will not list all possible locations where permissions can make an account a high value target for an attacker but instead focus on a method to detect highly privileged accounts in access control lists (ACL) on Active Directory objects.\nA long time ago I wrote a blog post on examples of these objects in Active Directory where you should pay extra attention: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/pfesweplat/forensics-active-directory-acl-investigation\nLet\u0026rsquo;s start off with an obvious example… the domain root. If a group of users has powerful permissions at the domain root they can practice their given right on all the objects below, except for the ones that are protected by AdminSDHolder. Normally you do not need to delegate permission at this level, even though it\u0026rsquo;s very common because it\u0026rsquo;s convenient and easy. Best practice is to delegate permissions at the domain level that only can be delegated here and delegate all other permissions on an OU level, near the scope of management. For example a frequently used permission that can only be delegated at the domain level is \u0026ldquo;Replicating Directory Changes\u0026rdquo;, which some applications might require to keep a replicated copy of the directory.\nObjectives You want to keep your highly privileged accounts managed and to do that you need to identify them.\nOne of the activities in doing that is to list accounts with critical permissions at the domain root.\n1. Examine access control list and understand what permissions are critical.\n2. Identify accounts and groups that are of importance for our assessment.\n3. List explicit added accounts and accounts granted access by membership in nested groups.\nFILTERING ACE\u0026rsquo;s To do that you can use the AD ACL Scanner. It has both a GUI and a command line mode, cool right? :) First, we will focus on using the command line mode since you easily can pipe the result to any other command you would like to use.\nBoth the command line and the GUI support creating reports in CSV, HTML and EXCEL. For Excel reports you don\u0026rsquo;t need to have Microsoft Office installed. Simply just install the PowerShell module ImportExcel by Doug Finke. Thanks Doug!\nPowerShell Command If you run ADACLScan.ps1 without parameters it will launch the graphical interface, but if you add the properly selected parameters you will run in command mode.\nTo run in command mode, you must add the -base (or the alias for the same -b) parameter and define a starting point using the distinguished name. I will use dc=contoso,dc=com which is the root of my domain.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -base \u0026#34;dc=contoso,dc=com\u0026#34; Our objective is to find any unexpected user accounts with critical permissions on the domain level.\nTo do that we run:\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical | ft And as you can see, we only received the critical permissions.\nBut this result contains a lot of expected users and groups.\nCan we exclude the default permissions? - Yes, we can!\nAdd the parameter -SkipDefaults to filter the result from default permissions.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults | ft Now we have a much shorter list to analyze. In our scenario we have good control of the built-in groups, so we are not interested in listing them here. Both Incoming Forest Trust Builders and Clonable Domain Controllers are groups we monitor and keep track of.\nCan we ignore these built-in groups? - Sure!\nAdd the -SkipBuiltin parameter to the command and it will ignore built-in groups.\n.\\ADACLScan.ps1 -b \u0026#34;DC=contoso,DC=com\u0026#34; -Criticality Critical -SkipDefaults -SkipBuiltIn | ft Ok, Now it\u0026rsquo;s just some custom ACE\u0026rsquo;s left. Wow, that\u0026rsquo;s much easier. Right?\nWell, the result contains groups and we need to know what user accounts are critical to the domain root.\nWe need to know who is member of these groups\u0026hellip; and the nested groups\u0026hellip; and the groups nested of these\u0026hellip; and so on\u0026hellip; Sigh!\nLet\u0026rsquo;s fix that!

A: No, this setting overrides the password policy in the domain or your fine grained password policy when you do reset password operations.\n So when is the \u0026ldquo;blank password\u0026rdquo; setting on user accounts effective:\nWhen users are delegated the permissions to do password resets on user accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD, they can set a blank password.\n A normal change password procedure by a user do not follow the ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD, it will follow the password policy in your domain or fine grained password policy if you got defined for the user.\nSo let say that an user with the delegate right to do password reset accidentally press OK in the password reset dialog box without the \u0026ldquo;User must change password at next logon\u0026rdquo; or someone in your organization with permissions to create user objects accentually runs a script that sets blank password. Then you will have accounts in you domain with no password. How do I find accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD? How will I know any of the accounts in my domain have \u0026ldquo;password not required\u0026rdquo; set? The easiest way to do it is to do a search with ADUC (Active Directory Users and Computers) mmc snap-in.\n Right click the domain root. Select Find\u0026hellip;. In the Find: drop down box select Custom Search. Click the Advanced tab. In the Enter LDAP Query: field type: (\u0026amp;(objectCategory=person)(objectClass=user)(userAccountControl:1.2.840.113556.1.4.803:=32)). Click Find Now.  How to create users To create users without allowing blank passwords you must deal with the userAccountContol values:\n\u0026ldquo;When a new user account is created, the userAccountControl attribute for the account automatically has the UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD flag set, which indicates that no password is required for the account. If the security policies of the domain that the account is created in requires a password for all user accounts, then the UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD flag must be removed from the userAccountControl attribute for the account.\u0026rdquo;\nHere you can read on how to create user accounts:\nCreating a user (Windows)\nPASSWD_NOTREQD flag:\nThis Vbscript code example will create a user with UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. The user will be allowed using blank passwords.\nSet objOU = GetObject(\u0026#34;LDAP://ou=sales,dc=contoso,dc=com\u0026#34;) Set objUser = objOU.Create(\u0026#34;User\u0026#34;, \u0026#34;cn=jsmith\u0026#34;) objUser.Put \u0026#34;sAMAccountName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;jsmith\u0026#34; objUser.Put \u0026#34;givenName\u0026#34;,\u0026#34;james\u0026#34; objUser.SetInfo objUser.put \u0026#34;userPrincipalName\u0026#34;,objUser.sAMAccountName \u0026amp; \u0026#34;@contoso.com\u0026#34; objUser.AccountDisabled = False strPassword = \u0026#34;P@ssW0rdPh@rse\u0026#34; objUser.SetPassword strPassword objUser.SetInfo This Vbscript code example manage the userAccountControl attribute.

Well, you can run a script to test every account against a blank password or why not find users with passwords that don\u0026rsquo;t comply with the password policy and remove the user setting for other users at the same time? :)\nHere\u0026rsquo;s a code-sample that remove the ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. If a user has a blank password the script will report an error stating it does not follow the password policy for the domain, as long as you have a password policy in the domain that requires minimum length above zero characters. If the script succeeds it will also report the status of the account, since if the account is also disabled it still could have a blank password.\nYou could test your environment with this code-sample and review the output.\nHopefully you do not have accounts with ADS_UF_PASSWD_NOTREQD. If you do you follow this procedure to find them.\nYou could still of course have accounts with blank passwords in case you had a domain password policy with no minimum password length. To remediate you have to make sure your password policies are in line with you security policy and that users are required to change their passwords and do not have \u0026ldquo;Password never expires\u0026rdquo; ticked in.\n","permalink":"https://managedpriv.com/blog/do-you-allow-blank-passwords-in-your-environment/","tags":["security","active directory","password"],"title":"Do You Allow Blank Passwords In Your Environment"}]
